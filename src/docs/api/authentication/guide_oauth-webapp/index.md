# Creating an OAuth Web App for the Laserfiche API

{: .note }
**Note:** The following guide only applies to Laserfiche Cloud.

Create an OAuth Web App when you want to write a web app where you can store server-side secrets and your app must perform actions on behalf of a user. The flow involves users granting access to their account.

## Register your Web App in the Developer Console

1. Sign in to the [Developer Console](../../../getting-started/developer-console/).
1. Click **New** to display the **Create Application** dialog box. Select the option to create a new app and then select the **Web App** app type and give the app a name.

1. On the **App Configuration** page, specify a redirect URI. The redirect URI must be a valid endpoint in the integration application. The OAuth service will send  an authorization code and access token to the Redirect URI in the OAuth flow. Only URIs with HTTPS or HTTP schemes are allowed. And HTTP is only supported for local hosts, e.g., http://localhost/callback  or http://localhost:11111/callback. Each Web App can have a maximum of 10 Redirect URIs registered.

1. Take note of the generated Client ID and Client Secret, as they will be necessary when communicating with the OAuth service.

1. In the **OAuth 2.0 Scopes** section, select the needed scopes for your application to function properly. See [OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Laserfiche APIs](../guide_oauth_2.0_scopes/) for more details.



## OAuth Authorization Code Grant Flow

1. Start the OAuth authorization code flow to get an access token that can be used to authenticate with the Laserfiche API. Web apps can optionally use the Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) extension for additional security to avoid an authorization code interception attack. For more details on how to use the code challenge and code verifier from the PKCE extension, view the [SPA OAuth flow guide](../guide_oauth-spa/).
    - Call the OAuth service authorization endpoint, including the *client_id* and *redirect_uri* query parameters for the registered app. See the following example authorization request.
        - ```xml
            GET https://signin.laserfiche.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=app1&response_type=code&state=someappstate&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fapp%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Fcallback&customerId=123456789&scope=repository.Read+repository.Write
        ```
    - The **client_id** parameter is the Client ID generated during the application registration process. It can be found on the Developer Console.
    - The **redirect_uri** parameter determines where the OAuth service redirects to after the authorization part. The value must match one of the redirect URIs specified during the application registration process. If the value is not found in application registration, it will return an error in the user's browser and no redirect will happen.
    - The **response_type** parameter is used by the application to inform the authorization server of the desired grant type. The value must be **code** for authorization code grant flow.
    - The **state** query parameter is optional but recommended. It is used to maintain the web application state between the request and callback. The parameter should be used to prevent cross-site request forgery as specified in the OAuth specification found in [RFC 6749 section 4.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.1).
    - The **customerId** parameter should be the same Laserfiche Cloud Account ID  used during the web app registration process.
    - The **scope** parameter determines the OAuth 2.0 scopes requested by the app. Scopes are case-sensitive and space-delimited. See [OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Laserfiche APIs](../guide_oauth_2.0_scopes/) for more details.

1. After sending the authorization request, the user will be redirected to sign in to Laserfiche Cloud if they are not already signed in. The user must sign in using the same Account ID as the one used for registering the web app. Otherwise, the OAuth service will return an error. If the user is already signed in to another Laserfiche Cloud service, the browser should already have the associated Laserfiche Cloud cookies. If the cookies exist, the process will skip the sign-in step and will show the consent page in next step directly.

1. The consent page will then be shown to the user to decide whether to grant the web app access to their credentials. The user will have 5 minutes to either confirm or deny the consent. After 5 minutes of inactivity, the OAuth service will return an error and they will need to start the authorization flow from the beginning.
    - If the user grants access, an authorization code will be generated and sent to the redirect_uri specified in the query parameter and the user's browser will be redirected to redirect_uri. If the state query parameter was used in the first step, it will be sent back with the authorization code. An example successful redirect request is shown below:
        - ```xml
            https://app.example.com/callback?scope=repository.Read+repository.Write&code=some_auth_code_value&state=someappstate
        ```
    - If the user denies access, an error will be sent to the redirect_uri specified in the query parameter and the user's browser will be redirected to redirect_uri. If the state query parameter was used in the first step, it will be sent back with the error. An example error redirect request is shown below:
        - ```xml
            https://app.example.com/callback?error=access_denied&error_description=Consent+has+not+been+given.&state=someappstate
        ```
    - Errors include:
        - **invalid_request:** An invalid request may be due to missing required fields.
        - **access_denied:** The user did not give consent to use their credentials, or the consent form has already been completed or expired.
        - **unauthorized_client:** The application type is not a web app.
        - **server_error:** The authorization server encountered an unexpected error.

1. After getting the authorization code, the application can exchange it for an access token by calling the token endpoint. The authorization code has a lifetime of 10 minutes. If not used within its lifetime, it will expire and the application must restart the authorization flow.
    - **Example Access Token Request**
        - ```xml
                POST https://signin.laserfiche.com/oauth/token HTTP/1.1
                Authorization: Basic *base64url-encoded-client_id-client_secret*
                Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

                grant_type=authorization_code&code=some_auth_code_value
                    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fapp%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Fcallback
        ```
        - The **grant_type** should be **authorization_code**.
        - The **code** should be the authorization code returned in the previous authorization step.
        - The **redirect_uri** should be identical to the one passed to the */authorize* endpoint in the previous authorization step.
        - The **Authorization** header should be **Basic** authorization with the **client_id** and **client_secret** base64url encoded and used as the username and password respectively. Both **client_id** and **client_secret** are generated during the application registration process and can be found on the Developer Console.
    - **Example Successful Access Token Response**
        - ```xml
            HTTP/1.1 200 OK
            Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

            {
            "access_token": "some_access_token_value",
            "token_type": "bearer",
            "expires_in": 3600,
            "refresh_token": "some_refresh_token_value",
            "scope": "repository.Read repository.Write"
            }
        ```
        - The returned access token includes an expiration time in seconds. Upon expiration, the application can use the refresh token to get a new one. The refresh token has a lifetime of around 8 hours from the time it was issued. The refresh token can also be invalidated when the user signs out from Laserfiche Cloud.
        - The returned scope is the granted scope by the OAuth Server.
    - **Example error response**
        - ```xml
            HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
            Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

            {
            "error": "invalid_client",
            "error_description": "The client credentials are invalid or authentication failed.",
            "type": "invalid_client",
            "title": "The client credentials are invalid or authentication failed.",
            "status": 401,
            "instance": "/Token",
            "operationId": "07f50babe09746a4b62346c3e89c4839",
            "traceId": "00-55eea5e3876a0c42a06ad1c78922e247-53d1e1ec0b933944-00"
            }
        ```
    - Error types include:
        - **unsupported_grant_type:** grant_type is not authorization_code.
        - **invalid_request:** Required field is missing.
        - **invalid_client:** The client authentication is missing or failed, or the client_id is invalid.
        - **unauthorized_client:** The application type is not a web app.
        - **invalid_grant:** redirect_uri does not match the one that started the authorization flow, or the authorization code is invalid or expired.

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Policy Information

Current CORS policy is to allow an *origin* only if its host (and port) is the same as that of the redirect URI that sent in the request to the *Authorize* api.

## Use the access token to access the Laserfiche API

Include the access token in the Bearer Authorization header when accessing the Laserfiche API.

Use the **Repositories** route to get a list of repositories current user have access to.
```xml
GET https://api.laserfiche.com/repository/v1/Repositories
Authorization: Bearer some_access_token_value
```

{: .note }
The OAuth access token is supported for repository v1 and later APIs.

You can make repository API calls like so:
````xml
GET https://api.laserfiche.com/repository/v1/Repositories/{repoId}/Entries/{entryId}
Authorization: Bearer some_access_token_value
```

## Refreshing an Access Token

When an access token expires, the web application can use the refresh token to get a new one.

**Example refresh token request**
```xml
POST https://signin.laserfiche.com/oauth/token HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic base64url-encoded-client_id-client_secret*
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=some_refresh_token_value
```
- The **grant_type** in the request body should be **refresh_token**.
- The **refresh_token** value should be the one returned along with access token in the previous get access token step.
- The **Authorization** header should be **Basic** authorization with the **client_id** and **client_secret** base64url encoded and used as the username and password respectively. Both **client_id** and **client_secret** are generated during the application registration process and can be found on the Developer Console.

**Example successful refresh token response**

In a successful response, the OAuth service will return a new access token with a new refresh token in the response. The new access token will have the same scope as the previous access token.
```xml
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

{
"access_token": "another_access_token_value",
"token_type": "bearer",
"expires_in": 3600,
"refresh_token": "another_refresh_token_value",
"scope": "repository.Read repository.Write"
}   
```

The old refresh token will be invalidated after the call. If the new access token expires, you must use the new refresh token to get another access token.

For security reasons, if an old refresh token is reused, the OAuth service will invalidate the current, i.e. the most recent, refresh token and return an error similar to the one below.

**Example error response**

```xml
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

{
"error": "invalid_grant",
"error_description": "The use of a previously used refresh token has been detected. As a security precaution, the refresh token has been invalidated.",
"type": "invalid_grant",
"title": "The use of a previously used refresh token has been detected. As a security precaution, the refresh token has been invalidated.",
"status": 400,
"instance": "/Token",
"operationId": "e59562d544154c88a17d8b842dd51c97",
"traceId": "00-5ec73ccfad5c6041b09001999b61aca4-87df063e7465a449-00"
}
```

{: .note }
For web applications, the new refresh token has a lifetime of around 8 hours from the time it was issued.
