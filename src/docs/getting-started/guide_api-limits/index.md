# API Limits
The Laserfiche API imposes certain limitations in order to sustain the quality and integrity of our cloud services for all customers. In the event of extraordinary resource contention, Laserfiche may impose temporary limits in addition to the **Laserfiche API limits** listed in the [Service Limits page](https://doc.laserfiche.com/laserfiche.documentation/en-us/Default.htm#Service-Limits.htm) in order to prevent service outages affecting all customers.

We are always looking to provide the optimal performance and experience for our customers. If you are consistently hitting these limits or these limits are a blocker for your integrationâ€™s solution, please contact your Solution Provider to reach out to our Support team and we can work to resolve the issue.

**Note:** For the Self-Hosted Laserfiche API Server, only the **Request and Response size limits** apply.
